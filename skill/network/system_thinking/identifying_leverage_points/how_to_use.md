# How to Use
**Prompt Instructions (How to Use):**  
1. When a user or sub-agent has mapped the system and needs strategic interventions.  
2. Particularly important after constructing causal loop diagrams or stock-flow models.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach:**  
1. Review system maps (CLDs, stocks/flows).  
2. Identify where the system is most sensitive—where a small change can shift outcomes significantly.  
3. Propose potential interventions (e.g., changing an information flow, adjusting a goal, altering feedback loops).

**Input Format Examples:**  
- Summaries of existing system diagrams or known problem hotspots.  
- “We have some proposed solutions; which might have the biggest overall effect?”

**Output Format Examples:**  
- Ranked list of possible interventions, with rationale.  
- Notes on trade-offs or potential unintended consequences.
