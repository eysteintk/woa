# Overview Stocks, Flows, and Delays

## Additional Overview Details
- **Stocks** are accumulations of resources (e.g., goods in a warehouse, money in a budget).  
- **Flows** are the rates at which these resources increase or decrease.  
- **Delays** are time lags between an action and its effect. Donella Meadows emphasizes that delays often cause oscillations.
