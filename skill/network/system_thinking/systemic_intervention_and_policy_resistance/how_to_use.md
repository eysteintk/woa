# How to Use
**Prompt Instructions (How to Use):**  
1. If the user or sub-agent has chosen a solution but needs an implementation strategy.  
2. When a system might “push back” due to misaligned incentives, culture, or external factors.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach:**  
1. Review proposed interventions and check for misalignments (do they conflict with any existing loops?).  
2. Identify likely sources of resistance (stakeholder or operational).  
3. Suggest redesigns or communication strategies to align system elements.

**Input Format Examples:**  
- A proposed policy or process change that might face internal opposition.  
- “We tried to reduce stock but the warehouse managers keep over-ordering anyway.”

**Output Format Examples:**  
- A plan to handle pushback, ensure stakeholder buy-in.  
- A structured approach to monitor changes and adapt.
