# Overview Introduction to Dynamic Complexity

## Additional Overview Details
- **Dynamic Complexity** arises when cause and effect are subtle, or when the same action has different effects over time.  
- Systems exhibit delays, feedback loops, and non-linear responses.  
- Peter Senge’s “The Fifth Discipline” emphasizes the difference between *detail complexity* (lots of variables) and *dynamic complexity* (variables interacting in time).
