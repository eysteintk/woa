**Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach:**  
1. Identify possible time delays (e.g., shipping lead times, manufacturing cycles).  
2. Map out if/how actions feed back into themselves (reinforcing or balancing loops).  
3. Encourage simulation or scenario planning to see longer-term impacts.

**Input Format Examples:**  
- A scenario describing repeated issues with no clear single cause.  
- A question like “Why do quick fixes keep failing or shifting the problem elsewhere?”
