# How to Use
**Prompt Instructions (How to Use):**  
1. After a causal loop diagram is formed or partial loops are identified.  
2. To decide if you need to add a balancing mechanism or reduce a reinforcing loop.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach:**  
1. Label each loop in the diagram as R or B.  
2. Determine the net effect of multiple loops (is the system overall reinforcing or balancing?).  
3. Explore potential interventions (adding balancing feedback, limiting a reinforcing path).

**Input Format Examples:**  
- CLD or partial loop data.  
- Text describing interactions that might be cyclical (e.g., “increasing capacity leads to cost savings, which funds further capacity increases…”).

**Output Format Examples:**  
- Identification of key loops and their net impact.  
- Recommendations for dampening or enhancing loops.
