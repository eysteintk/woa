# When to Use & Limitations
**When to Use This Skill:**  
- During mid to late stages of analysis when you have a sense of system loops.  

**Limitations:**  
- Doesn’t guarantee you’ve found *all* loops—some might remain hidden.  
- Requires integration with real-world data to validate loop assumptions.
