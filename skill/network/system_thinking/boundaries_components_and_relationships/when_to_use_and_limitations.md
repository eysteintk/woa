# When to Use & Limitations
**When to Use This Skill:**  
- Early in any project or root cause analysis.  
- Whenever the user is uncertain about the scope.

**Limitations:**  
- May overlook some external elements if boundaries are not well-defined or if user input is incomplete.  
- Works best when combined with other advanced skills (e.g., causal loops) for deeper analysis.
