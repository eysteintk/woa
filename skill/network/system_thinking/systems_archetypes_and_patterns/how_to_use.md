# How to Use
**Prompt Instructions (How to Use):**  
1. Use when an ongoing issue exhibits a pattern that seems familiar (e.g., repeated quick fixes).  
2. Another agent might suspect “this is a ‘Shifting the Burden’ scenario.”

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach:**  
1. Ask clarifying questions to uncover patterns (e.g., is there repeated short-term relief that undermines a longer-term fix?).  
2. Match those patterns to known archetypes.  
3. Suggest typical “leverage points” to break the cycle.

**Input Format Examples:**  
**Output Format Examples:**  
- A named archetype (if identified), plus recommended next steps or reading.  
- Explanation of how that archetype typically unfolds.
