# How to Use
**Prompt Instructions (How to Use):**  
1. When you have a set of variables or factors that might be feeding into each other.  
2. After identifying dynamic complexity, but need a visual or conceptual map.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach:**  
1. Gather key variables (e.g., “inventory level,” “customer demand”).  
2. Show how a change in one variable influences another (with plus/minus notation).  
3. Identify and label loops as Reinforcing (R) or Balancing (B).  
4. Interpret potential outcomes and leverage points.

**Input Format Examples:**  
- Lists of variables or short statements like “Demand goes up, so we produce more, which eventually lowers demand,” etc.  
- Data from an operational environment that suggests cyclical problems.

**Output Format Examples:**
