# How to Use
**Prompt Instructions (How to Use):**  
1. When repeated 5 Whys don’t seem to solve the issue.  
2. If the user suspects the “root cause” is spread across multiple interacting variables.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach:**  
1. Perform initial RCA using 5 Whys or fishbone diagrams.  
2. Map how each “why” might connect in a feedback loop.  
3. Distinguish true systemic drivers from mere symptoms or single-incident events.

**Input Format Examples:**  
- A scenario with “We tried solving X, but it keeps coming back.”  
- Lists of potential causes or symptoms.

**Output Format Examples:**  
- A hierarchy or network of causes.  
- Proposed interventions at multiple levels (operational, policy, cultural).
