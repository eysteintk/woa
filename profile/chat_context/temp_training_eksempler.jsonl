Note that at the time of writing, fine-tuning of GPT-4 itself is still in limited beta, but the overall method for data preparation is similar to that for GPT-3.5-turbo.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understand Fine-Tuning Data Requirements\n\nFor OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.), fine-tuning data typically uses a [JSONL format](https://docs.openai.com/gpt3/fine-tuning#preparing-your-dataset). Each line (training example) in the file must contain at least two keys:\n```json5\n{\"prompt\": \"YOUR_PROMPT_TEXT\", \"completion\": \"YOUR_COMPLETION_TEXT\"}\n```\n- **prompt**: The input or question that you gave to the model\n- **completion**: The desired output you want the model to produce\n\nIf you want multi-turn chat style data, you have a few options (more on that below). Typically, for coding tasks, you just need to ensure that each piece of text you want the model to *respond to* is in `prompt`, and the *ideal or corrected output* is in `completion`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Export and Parse Your Chat Logs\n\n1. **Export**  \n   You mentioned you already exported the entire chat history with the assistant. Ensure it’s in a format you can reliably parse (e.g., JSON, CSV, or just raw text with clear markers for user and assistant).\n\n2. **Segment the Conversation**  \n   - Identify each user prompt and the corresponding assistant response.\n   - You’ll typically want one “prompt-completion” pair for every single user→assistant interaction.  \n   - If you have back-and-forth instructions (like a user clarifying something and the assistant responding again), you can consider either combining multiple user messages into one prompt, or keep them separated as multiple training examples.  \n   - The key is to decide how granular you want each example to be. Usually, the simpler approach is one user question + assistant answer = one training record.\n\n3. **Clean Up**  \n   - Remove extraneous content (e.g., disclaimers, repeated “Let me see” filler text, or system instructions you don’t want the model to replicate).\n   - Strip out references to ChatGPT, brand names, or personal info unless it’s crucial to your coding domain.\n   - Simplify the user prompts if you want the model to need fewer tokens. (For example, if the user typed “Could you please do X? That would be awesome,” you can shorten that to “Generate X.”)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Structure Each Example in JSONL\n\nAssume you end up with pairs like this in a CSV or in-memory structure (each row or item is a single prompt→completion pair):\n\n```plaintext\nUser:    \"Can you create a function in Python that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to n?\"\nAssistant: \"Sure. Here’s a Python function:\\n\\n```python\\ndef fibonacci(n):\\n    ...\\n```\"\n```\n\nYou’ll convert each pair into JSON. A single example might look like:\n\n```json\n{\"prompt\": \"Can you create a function in Python that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to n?\", \n \"completion\": \"Sure. Here’s a Python function:\\n\\n```python\\ndef fibonacci(n):\\n    ...\\n```\"}\n```\n\nThen you place each example on its own line in a `.jsonl` file:\n\n```\n{\"prompt\":\"PROMPT_1\",\"completion\":\"COMPLETION_1\"}\n{\"prompt\":\"PROMPT_2\",\"completion\":\"COMPLETION_2\"}\n...\n```\n\n> **Tip:** If your code blocks are large, you’ll want to ensure you strip out unnecessary whitespace or extraneous conversation. GPT models can handle code as text just fine, but large lumps of text also use more tokens.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Decide on Multi-Turn vs. Single-Turn Format\n\nYou have a choice to preserve multi-turn context in each training example or break them up:\n\n1. **Single-Turn**  \n   - Each user query and the assistant’s immediate answer is one example.  \n   - Easier to create large, consistent datasets.  \n   - Encourages the model to produce direct answers to single prompts (which is often best for code generation).\n\n2. **Multi-Turn**  \n   - Merge multiple back-and-forth messages into a single `prompt`, so that the entire conversation is shown.  \n   - The final assistant message becomes the `completion`.  \n   - This can help the model learn how to handle context across multiple messages, but each example may become large.  \n   - You also end up with fewer total examples unless you have many multi-turn dialogues.\n\nFor general code generation tasks, single-turn format is typically sufficient. If you rely heavily on context from many user clarifications, you can test multi-turn examples as well.\n\n---\n\n## 5. (Optional) Add Instruction or System Prompts\n\nIf you used system prompts in your conversation (e.g., “You are ChatGPT…”), you might decide to include them in your training data as part of the prompt. Alternatively, you can omit them if you don’t need the model to replicate that exact behavior.  \n\nSome developers add an explicit “instruction style” structure in the prompt, for example:\n\n```\n{\"prompt\": \"<system>\\nYou are a helpful coding assistant.\\n</system>\\n<user>\\nCan you show me how to do X in Python?\\n</user>\", \n \"completion\": \"<assistant>\\nCertainly! Here’s how...\\n</assistant>\"}\n```\n\nBut this is optional—plain text prompts also work fine.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Validate and Test a Small Batch First\n\n1. **Validate** your JSONL file with a simple Python script (or any JSONL validator) to ensure there are no parse errors.  \n2. **Test** a few prompts in the OpenAI fine-tuning environment (when GPT-4 fine-tuning is available) or with GPT-3.5 to confirm things are working.  \n3. **Iterate** quickly. You might discover that shorter prompts lead to better results or that certain conversation sections are not necessary.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Keep in Mind Token Usage\n\n- Fine-tuning data counts toward your training token usage. If your prompts are extremely verbose, your training costs increase.  \n- Once the model is fine-tuned, you can typically shorten your inference prompts because the model will have learned specific context from your training data.  \n- If you see repeated code blocks that are basically the same, consider whether you can condense them into fewer, more representative examples (to save on tokens and focus the training set on variety rather than repetition).\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow Summary\n\n1. **Export** your existing chat logs to a single text or JSON file.  \n2. **Parse** out each user → assistant pair.  \n3. **For each pair**, create a dictionary with two keys: `\"prompt\"` and `\"completion\"`.  \n4. **Write** each dictionary on its own line in a `.jsonl` file.  \n5. **Clean** or trim data as needed, removing irrelevant or sensitive info.  \n6. (Optionally) **add** system or instruction prompts if needed.  \n7. **Validate** your `.jsonl` file.  \n8. **Submit** for fine-tuning (when GPT-4 fine-tuning is accessible).\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n- The essence of fine-tuning is giving your model enough *representative* data of what you want it to produce.  \n- Repetitive or unnecessary text can degrade performance and increase cost.  \n- Tailor the dataset to the kinds of prompts you expect to give the model in production.\n\nBy carefully structuring your conversation data in a JSONL “prompt→completion” format, then fine-tuning, you’ll likely see the model produce code completions more aligned with your style and with reduced prompt engineering overhead.", "weight": 1}]}

The general idea is:\n\n1. Identify each “chunk” where the **user** asks or provides context (including multiple code files), and where the **assistant** responds (potentially with multiple code files).  \n2. Decide if you want a **multi-turn** example (i.e., combine multiple user messages and assistant replies into a single prompt→completion) or a **single-turn** example (each user message and assistant reply is one dataset row).  \n3. Format them into JSON lines, one example per line, with `\"prompt\"` and `\"completion\"` keys.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Extracting Segments from a Single Long Chat\n\n### A. Splitting by Turn\n\n1. **Identify the user messages**: Mark each user block where you asked or provided instructions/code.  \n2. **Identify the assistant messages**: Mark each assistant block where it responded with instructions/code.\n\nIf your chat export is text-only, you might see something like:\n\n```\nUser (timestamp...):\nHere's my code for the backend. [long code snippet 1]\nHere's another code file for the frontend. [long code snippet 2]\nI need help to connect them using an API route.\n\nAssistant (timestamp...):\nSure! Here is an example of how you can link them together...\n[assistant code snippet 1]\n[assistant code snippet 2]\n\nUser (timestamp...):\nNow I'm getting an error about 'undefined variable' in snippet 1.\n\nAssistant (timestamp...):\nOkay, let’s fix that by...\n[assistant fix code snippet]\n```\n\nEach pair of `(User → Assistant)` can be turned into **one** training example if you’re aiming for a single-turn approach. If you want multi-turn, you might combine multiple user messages into a single prompt, followed by the final assistant response as the completion.  \n\n### B. Deciding on Single-Turn vs. Multi-Turn\n\n1. **Single-Turn**  \n   - Each user message + immediate assistant answer = **1 JSON object**.  \n   - This is straightforward.  \n   - For code generation, it’s often sufficient because you typically ask a question, get an answer, and that’s one “prompt→completion.”\n\n2. **Multi-Turn**  \n   - You’d concatenate multiple user messages (and possibly the intermediate assistant answers) into one large prompt, and the final assistant response is the completion.  \n   - This can help preserve the context of a continued conversation, but each record may become very large in terms of tokens.\n\nIf each user message and assistant response is extremely long (multiple code files), single-turn is usually more manageable and will keep each training example more focused.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Structuring Multiple Code Files in the Prompt or Completion\n\nSince code is treated as text by GPT models, the simplest method is to encapsulate each code snippet in backticks or fences. For instance:\n\n```plaintext\nUSER PROMPT:\nI'm working on two files:\n\n**file1.py**:\n```\n<code for file1>\n```\n\n**file2.py**:\n```\n<code for file2>\n```\n\nI want to know how to connect them. Any advice?\n\nASSISTANT COMPLETION:\nSure! Here is an updated **file1.py** and **file2.py**:\n\n```\n<assistant code for file1>\n```\n\n```\n<assistant code for file2>\n```\n\nExplanation: ...\n```\n\nWhen you turn this into JSON, you can do something like:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"I'm working on two files:\\n\\n**file1.py**:\\n```python\\n<code for file1>\\n```\\n\\n**file2.py**:\\n```python\\n<code for file2>\\n```\\n\\nI want to know how to connect them. Any advice?\",\n  \"completion\": \"Sure! Here is an updated **file1.py** and **file2.py**:\\n\\n```python\\n<assistant code for file1>\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n<assistant code for file2>\\n```\\n\\nExplanation: ...\"\n}\n```\n\nYou’d have one record like that per `(User → Assistant)` pair.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Generating the JSONL File\n\nOnce you split out each pair, you might have something like (in a simplified example with just two turns):\n\n1. **Turn 1**  \n   - User: \"Here’s file1.py and file2.py, help me connect them.\"  \n   - Assistant: \"Sure, here’s how...\"  \n\n2. **Turn 2**  \n   - User: \"I got an error about 'undefined variable.'\"  \n   - Assistant: \"You need to define the variable in file1.py like so...\"  \n\nIn your `.jsonl` file, each line is a separate JSON object:\n\n```\n{\"prompt\":\"Here’s file1.py and file2.py, help me connect them.\\n\\nfile1.py:\\n```python\\n...\\n```\\n\\nfile2.py:\\n```python\\n...\\n```\",\"completion\":\"Sure, here’s how:\\n\\n```python\\n...\\n```\"}\n{\"prompt\":\"I got an error about 'undefined variable.'\\n\\nfile1.py snippet:\\n```python\\n...\\n```\",\"completion\":\"You need to define the variable in file1.py like so...\\n\\n```python\\n...\\n```\"}\n```\n\nYou’d continue adding lines like that for each user→assistant exchange.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Handling Extra-Large Code Blocks\n\n- **Max token limit**: If any single example is huge (many thousands of tokens), you risk going over the model’s context window limit during training or inference. For GPT-4, that can be higher than GPT-3.5, but still, you may want to:\n  - Break extremely large code snippets into smaller chunks.  \n  - Only include the essential parts of your code rather than entire large libraries, unless the model needs the full library for context.\n\n- **De-duplication**: If you frequently paste the same code in many consecutive user prompts or answers, consider abbreviating or referencing previously provided code. Too much repetition can bloat your dataset and cost more tokens without improving performance.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cleanup and Filtering\n\n- **Remove personal or extraneous info**: If the conversation has meta-chatter (“Sure, let me see if I can do that” or “Oops, that didn’t work”), you can remove it unless it’s relevant to how you want the model to respond.  \n- **Keep only relevant Q&A**: Focus on the sections that demonstrate the user queries about code + the correct best-practice or helpful answer.  \n- **Ensure consistency**: Make sure the user prompts and your completions read smoothly when placed in the final JSON. You don’t want truncated code blocks or incomplete sentences.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Validate the JSONL\n\nFinally, confirm that each line in your `.jsonl` file is valid JSON. You can do a quick check in Python or any other language with something like:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nwith open(\"training_data.jsonl\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n    for i, line in enumerate(f, start=1):\n        try:\n            json.loads(line)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n            print(f\"Line {i} is invalid JSON: {e}\")\n            break\n```\n\nIf everything is valid, you’re ready to proceed with fine-tuning (once GPT-4 fine-tuning is generally available).\n\n---\n\n### Summary Steps\n\n1. **Export** or copy your entire chat.  \n2. **Identify** each user message and the corresponding assistant response.  \n3. **Decide** if each (user → assistant) pair will become **one** row in your dataset (most common for coding Q&A).  \n4. **Wrap** code in fenced code blocks (```` ```python ... ``` ````) so it’s clear in plain text.  \n5. **Format** into JSON with `\"prompt\"` and `\"completion\"` keys.  \n6. **Write** each example to a new line in a `.jsonl` file.  \n7. **Validate** the file.  \n8. **Fine-tune** (when the GPT-4 fine-tuning pathway is open).\n\nWith that process, you’ll have a clean dataset of prompt→completion pairs, even if each pair includes multiple code files. This should help GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5-turbo) learn from your specific coding patterns and reduce the need for huge prompts in the future.", "weight": 1}]}

Lines of Code vs. Tokens\n\nWhen we talk about “tokens,” that’s how GPT and other language models measure text length. But since you’re dealing mainly with code, it’s easier to think in **lines of code** (LOC). A few rules of thumb:\n\n- **1–5 lines of code** (short function) might be around 50–100 tokens.\n- **50–100 lines of code** might be around 1,000–2,000 tokens.\n- **300–500 lines of code** can easily exceed 5,000 tokens, depending on formatting and comments.\n\nFor most GPT models:\n- GPT-3.5-turbo typically has a context window of around 4,000 tokens (though a “16k” context window version is also available).\n- GPT-4 can have an 8k or even 32k token context window (depending on the version you have access to).\n\n### Why Does This Matter?\n- If your snippets are **very large** (for example, 500+ lines), a single prompt might exceed the model’s maximum context limit during training or inference.\n- During **fine-tuning**, each training example also consumes tokens; extremely large code examples make the dataset huge and expensive (and can sometimes degrade performance if the model never sees the “forest” among the “trees”).\n\nThat said, if your **typical** code snippet is under a couple hundred lines, you’re usually fine for GPT-4’s larger context window. Just be aware that if you have repeated 1,000+ line files in each training example, you may run into context or cost issues.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Multi-Turn: Ideal for Code Refinement\n\nYou mentioned you **rarely get the code you need in a single turn**—you always refine or add new context in multiple turns. That suggests you should preserve the back-and-forth in your training data. Here’s how you can do that:\n\n### A. Combine Multiple Turns into One Training Example\n\nSuppose you have a conversation like this:\n\n```\nUser: \n\"Here’s file1.py (100 lines). I need help rewriting it to follow best practices.\"\n\nAssistant: \n\"Try these revisions... [Assistant’s updated code1, 50 lines].\"\n\nUser: \n\"That works partially, but now file2.py needs to import some definitions from file1.py. Here’s file2.py (another 80 lines).\"\n\nAssistant:\n\"Sure, here’s how to integrate the two files... [Assistant’s updated code2, etc.].\"\n```\n\nYou can merge all of that conversation into **one single prompt** (multi-turn context) and have the **final** assistant answer as the completion. Something like:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"User: Here’s file1.py (100 lines). I need help rewriting it to follow best practices.\\nAssistant: Try these revisions...\\nUser: That works partially, but now file2.py needs to import definitions from file1.py...\\n\", \n  \"completion\": \"Sure, here’s how to integrate them...\"\n}\n```\n\n- You’d place **all** relevant user messages (and possibly intermediate assistant responses if they’re needed for context) in the `\"prompt\"`.\n- The **final** assistant message from that entire conversation goes into `\"completion\"`.\n\n> **Note**: The bigger the conversation, the more lines of code it might include, so watch out for the context limit or extremely large `.jsonl` entries.\n\n### B. Multiple Multi-Turn Examples vs. One Giant Example\n\n- You don’t necessarily want to throw your **entire** multi-day chat log into one single example. That would become unmanageably large.  \n- Instead, **split** logically around each major request. If each conversation “arc” is about a particular feature or bug fix, make that entire arc (with the final solution) one multi-turn example. Then move on to the next arc as a new training example.\n\n### C. Single-Turn Approach (For Reference)\n\nIf you decided on single-turn, you’d break each user→assistant exchange into its own row. That’s simpler but loses some of the iterative improvement context. For your use case, multi-turn is more aligned with how you actually code and debug.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical Tips\n\n1. **Concise Snippets**: When adding large code blocks, consider if you can remove boilerplate, generated code, or repeated code that isn’t crucial to the point of the conversation. This helps keep each training example smaller and more focused.\n\n2. **Clear Delimiters**: Use fenced code blocks (` ```python ... ``` `) in your JSON strings so it’s easy for the model to parse code from descriptive text.\n\n3. **Check Length**: For multi-turn examples with many lines of code, do a quick length check:\n   - If you exceed 400–500 lines of combined code across user and assistant in a single example, you might bump into token constraints (especially in smaller context models).\n   - For GPT-4 with a 32k context window, you have more wiggle room, but you still might not want a single multi-turn example that’s thousands of lines.\n\n4. **Validate**: If you’re merging multiple turns into a single example, be sure your final `\"prompt\"` text is coherent (i.e., it’s clearly user and assistant in chronological order) and your final `\"completion\"` is the last answer you want the model to reproduce.\n\n---\n\n### Wrapping Up\n\n- **Estimate by lines**: If you have code blocks around 100–200 lines in each user or assistant message, that’s often safe for GPT-4’s 8k or 16k/32k context window. Larger code blocks (300+ lines) might push the token limit if combined with multiple turns in a single example.\n- **Use multi-turn**: Since you refine code over multiple messages, combine those messages into single training examples, but chunk them logically (one feature or bug fix per example) so you’re not putting an entire day’s chat into one JSON object.\n- **Keep it relevant**: Omit repetitive or irrelevant lines to keep your training set smaller and more targeted.\n\nWith this multi-turn approach, the model can learn the iterative refining style of your coding sessions, so it’s better prepared to give you the refined code faster in future prompts.", "weight": 1}]}

In those cases:\n     - Break the conversation into logical chunks (for example, one feature or bug fix per training example).  \n     - Strip out repeated sections that don’t directly affect the latest code changes.\n\n5. **Multi-turn is often best for iterative refinement**  \n   - If your normal workflow involves multiple corrections and re-checks, keep those turns together in one training example (up to the point where you have a final, working version).  \n   - Don’t combine an entire day’s worth of development into one mega-example; chunk it by feature or issue.\n\nIn short:\n- **If you need full-code outputs in real usage, include full (but relevant) code in your training data.**  \n- **If certain large blocks never change or aren’t crucial, remove or reduce them.**  \n- **If code is repeated in many messages, reference or briefly show it rather than pasting the exact same text each time.**  \n- **For a multi-turn workflow, group each set of refinements for a single feature/bug fix into one cohesive training example.**\n\nThese steps let you retain enough detail for complete code generation without ballooning your data or forcing the model to learn from many copies of the same code.", "weight": 1}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "User prefers precise and direct answers, avoiding vague phrases like \"forest for the trees.\" They dislike AI models like Google Gemini that output code extracts instead of full code files, and they are concerned that such output styles may be a result of how the training data was structured and possibly summarized.", "weight": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "Model set context updated."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For fine-tuning purposes, you should keep **enough of the code to provide clear context** for the task you're refining. Generally:\n\n1. **Include the entire relevant code context** in each example (i.e., the user query + full assistant response, including all necessary code files). Do **not** cut off large parts unless they are completely irrelevant to the task. Keeping full files helps the model understand the whole context.\n\n2. If code files are too large to fit into a single example (e.g., they would exceed the token limit), you can **split them** into multiple examples where each split focuses on specific portions or steps. Ensure each split is **coherent**, meaning it should still make sense on its own. For example, if one file is very large, you might first focus on function definitions in one example and then the implementation in another.\n\n3. **Summarizing code**: You could use an LLM to summarize portions of your code to reduce the size of your examples. However, this comes with the risk of losing important context or meaning, especially for detailed, nuanced code. If you summarize code, make sure the summary **captures all the essential logic** and functionality, and avoid summarizing parts that could impact the model's understanding of the task.\n\n4. **Avoid extracts**: To prevent the model from outputting partial code, you should ensure your training data always includes full code files (if relevant) as part of the prompt and completion. This reinforces the model's ability to generate complete code rather than just extracts.\n\nBy focusing on **full files and comprehensive examples**, you encourage the model to output full code files and make better use of context, as opposed to fragmentary code snippets.", "weight": 1}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "User prefers precise answers and dislikes vague phrases like \"forest for the trees.\" They are concerned that some AI models, like Google Gemini, output code extracts rather than full code files, which they believe might be due to how the training data was structured and possibly summarized.", "weight": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "Model set context updated."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To answer your question precisely:\n\n### 1. **How much code to keep**:\n- **Keep essential code**: Retain the portions of code that directly relate to the user’s query or the solution the assistant is providing. \n- **Omit boilerplate**: Remove repetitive or non-critical sections, such as:\n  - Imports that are standard (unless they are central to the discussion).\n  - Large documentation strings or comments that don’t add value to the task at hand.\n  - Repeated patterns or default code that doesn’t change (e.g., same function signature, standard initialization code).\n  \nThis keeps the example focused on what’s important without overwhelming the model with unnecessary details.\n\n### 2. **Use of Summarization**:\n- **Summarize for clarity, not for length**: If the code is long but somewhat redundant, summarizing might help. However, only do so if it makes the code’s intent clearer, and not if it sacrifices important context.\n- **Avoid over-summarizing**: Over-summarization might remove context, which could lead to a reduction in code generation quality. For example, if you're training the model with a very specific error or issue in a large code base, make sure the training example still includes that specific code (even if it’s a large block).\n\n### 3. **Full Code Files vs. Code Extracts**:\n- If you need full code files (as in your case), ensure that your dataset contains complete blocks of code, not just fragments. This way, the model can learn to generate comprehensive, full-file responses rather than partial snippets.\n- Some AI models, like Google Gemini, output **code extracts** because the training data may be highly fragmented or optimized for smaller prompts. If you don’t want this kind of output, make sure your fine-tuning data **preserves the entire code context**. For GPT models, always include enough context in the prompt for the model to generate the entire file as a response.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Keep the code **relevant** to the task.\n- Summarize only to enhance **clarity**, not to reduce length.\n- Ensure your fine-tuning data contains **complete code files** if that’s what you want as output.\n\nThis should guide your dataset preparation for fine-tuning, and reduce the need for excessive prompt engineering.", "weight": 1}]}

Denne transporten er en del av en logistikk-kjede med små tidsmarginer for å minimere ledetid for kunde. Volum er variabelt gjennom uker og sesong. Avganger er strategisk planlagt basert på gjennomsnittlige historiske volum. Taktisk planlegging skjer basert på totalt varevolum pr avgang etter stopptid.\r\n\r\nDette har to hovedutfordringer:\r\n1. Transportbehovet (palleplasser) avhenger betydelig av varetyper og kundesammensetning pr avgang, noe som gir lav nøyaktighet i planleggingen.\r\n2.

These suggestions blend root-cause analysis, systems thinking, and practical project steps.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clarify the Real Problem Beyond the Symptoms\n- **Explicitly define the ‘why’**  \n  High costs (260 MNOK/year) is a symptom. What are the deeper causes behind these high costs? Is it excessive variability, siloed data flows, inaccurate forecasts, or operational constraints (e.g., loading/unloading times, routes, scheduling)? You can use techniques like the **5 Whys** or **Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams** to dig deeper.\n- **Map the system**  \n  Before talking about a new AI model or platform, consider creating a high-level **value-stream map** of the end-to-end process (from forecasting and ordering in the warehouse systems all the way to delivery scheduling). This helps identify hidden bottlenecks, constraints, and drivers of cost.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Establish a Baseline and “As-Is” Analysis\nThe project plan describes the development of an AI model and data platform, but it doesn’t explicitly mention a baseline analysis of the current processes.\n\n- **Data-driven baseline**  \n  - Gather data on how transport currently works (e.g., average utilization rates, reasons for last-minute capacity changes, lead time variance).  \n  - Define clear KPIs (e.g., current fill rates, average weekly transport usage vs. capacity, forecast error rates).\n- **Operational mapping**  \n  - Document the current workflow: who makes the transport decisions, when, and how.  \n  - Identify manual or reactive steps where errors or guesswork occur.\n\nWithout quantifying the current state—and the underlying reasons for short lead times, variability, or capacity mismatches—you risk building solutions for poorly defined problems.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Root Cause Analysis and Systems Thinking\nA thorough root cause analysis ensures you don’t build a fix for the wrong issue.\n\n- **Identify main drivers**  \n  - Is the volatility in orders driven by promotions, seasonality, or store ordering patterns?  \n  - Could lead times be compressed (or made more predictable) if internal or external steps change (e.g., warehouse picking processes, cut-off times, or route planning constraints)?\n- **Examine interdependencies**  \n  - How do changes in one part of the system (e.g., earlier picking completion) affect others (e.g., more stable truck departure times)?  \n  - Look at upstream/downstream influences: Are suppliers or store order cycles feeding this volatility?\n\nSystems thinking emphasizes the chain of cause-and-effect loops. The cost of “mellomtransport” doesn’t exist in isolation; it’s influenced by inventory policies, store replenishment rules, route planning, and more.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Involve All Key Stakeholders Early\nWhile you do list “Driftsressurser” from SL Kjøl, ASKO Transport, etc., it’s crucial that they are not just informed but **co-own** the analysis stage.\n\n- **Workshop sessions**  \n  - Facilitate workshops with warehouse managers, transport planners, store representatives, and data/IT teams to surface pain points.  \n  - Encourage them to articulate potential root causes and system constraints.  \n- **Cross-functional teams**  \n  - Ensure the business experts and operational folks have direct input into model requirements (e.g., how forecasting errors affect actual loading, typical manual workarounds).\n\nOften, missed insights come from not involving the on-the-ground stakeholders soon enough.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Align on Measurable Success Criteria—Not Just Cost\nYou mention an annual savings target of 1.5–3 MNOK, but also consider what else would signify a truly effective solution.\n\n- **Complementary KPIs**  \n  - Forecast accuracy improvements (e.g., measure forecast error over weeks/months).  \n  - Improved truck fill rate or reduction in “emergency capacity.”  \n  - Reduction in manual planning hours.  \n  - On-time departure rates with fewer last-minute changes.  \n- **Ensure you have baseline metrics** for each KPI so you can prove genuine improvement and not just nominal cost savings.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Pilot or Iterate Before a Full-Scale Rollout\nThe activities list shows a fairly linear approach (build model, expand, etc.). Consider rapid prototyping or smaller pilots to validate assumptions and uncover hidden complexities.\n\n- **Pilot approach**  \n  - Start with one warehouse (SL Kjøl) or one route, gather feedback, measure improvements in cost and capacity usage.  \n  - Iterate the model or process changes based on pilot results before expanding to SL Tørr or ASKO Øst.  \n- **Incremental deployment**  \n  - Deploy new forecasting logic or data feeds in stages, ensuring each stage delivers measurable value and surfaces new insights.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Ensure a Process/Change Management Plan\nIt’s not just about building a model; the organization needs to adapt workflows, roles, responsibilities, and mindset.\n\n- **New processes for planning**  \n  - Who owns the revised transport planning steps once the AI model outputs a forecast?  \n  - How do you handle exceptions and override the model’s suggestions when needed?\n- **Training & adoption**  \n  - Ensure staff understand how to interpret and act on the model’s results.  \n  - Plan for a transition period where both manual methods and the AI tool are used in parallel.\n\nA robust change management plan reduces resistance and sets the foundation for long-term use.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Governance and Ongoing Improvement\nFinally, once the model goes live, how do you sustain improvement?\n\n- **Feedback loops**  \n  - Continuously gather forecasting error metrics and real transport usage data.  \n  - Feed that back into iterative model improvements.  \n- **Governance structure**  \n  - Who is responsible for maintaining the model, updating business rules, and troubleshooting data quality issues going forward?  \n  - What’s the cadence for reviewing performance and making strategic changes?\n\nWithout a governance plan, the model risks becoming outdated or mismatched to actual operations.\n\n---\n\n### Summing It Up\nYour current project plan focuses on building a solution (an AI model + data platform), but it’s crucial to embed systematic problem exploration, stakeholder engagement, and iterative refinement. By conducting a thorough root cause analysis and mapping the broader system, you ensure that the final solution addresses the real drivers of cost and complexity—not just the symptoms.", "weight": 1}]}

*Description:* Understand what systems thinking is: seeing the whole rather than isolated parts.  \n   - *Key Points:* \n     - Definition of a “system” and interconnectivity of its components  \n     - Why local optimizations don’t always lead to global improvements  \n     - Basics of cause-and-effect in complex organizations  \n\n2. **Defining the Problem**  \n   - *Description:* Master the ability to frame a problem correctly before jumping to solutions (e.g., 5 Whys).  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Importance of distinguishing symptoms vs. root causes  \n     - Use of 5 Whys, Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams  \n     - Recognizing “mellomtransport cost” is a symptom—what drives that cost?\n\n3. **Organizational Context**  \n   - *Description:* Be aware of your company’s structure, goals, and constraints—vital for seeing how a single project (like mellomtransport) fits into the bigger picture.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Where mellomtransport sits in the supply chain (SL Kjøl, SL Tørr, ASKO Transport, etc.)  \n     - Key stakeholders, organizational silos, and decision-making processes  \n     - Basics of corporate strategies (cost-saving targets, service level commitments)\n\n---\n\n### **Tier 2 – Intermediate Analysis Skills**\nOnce you grasp the fundamentals, level up to tools that let you map, measure, and analyze complex systems more thoroughly.\n\n4. **System Mapping & Value-Stream Analysis**  \n   - *Description:* Learn techniques for visually mapping processes and identifying flows (goods, information, money).  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Value-stream mapping (steps from order forecasting to transport planning)  \n     - Identifying bottlenecks in SL (e.g., last-minute capacity planning for mellomtransport)  \n     - Recognizing interplay between forecasting tools (Luminate, SAP, IMI WH)  \n\n5. **Causal Loop Diagrams**  \n   - *Description:* Understand how feedback loops create reinforcing or balancing dynamics.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Positive (reinforcing) vs. negative (balancing) loops  \n     - Example: More last-minute changes \\=> higher cost \\=> more attempts at quick fixes \\=> can lead to even more last-minute changes  \n     - Identifying leverage points (e.g., earlier planning or improved forecast accuracy)\n\n6. **Measuring Variability & Constraints**  \n   - *Description:* Identify how variability (e.g., seasonal volumes, promotions) and constraints (e.g., truck capacity, cut-off times) affect overall system performance.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Different types of constraints: physical (truck capacity), time-based (stopptid), operational (warehouse throughput)  \n     - Effects of demand volatility on transport planning  \n     - Concept of lead times and buffering\n\n7. **Stakeholder & Interdependency Analysis**  \n   - *Description:* Understand how different internal and external parties (warehouse, transport planners, stores) are interdependent.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Identifying each stakeholder’s KPIs and constraints  \n     - Facilitating workshops to reveal hidden dependencies (e.g., store ordering patterns that spike demand unpredictably)  \n     - Communication strategies to align on shared goals\n\n---\n\n### **Tier 3 – Advanced Systems Thinking & Application**\nMaster-level skills that enable you to guide large-scale initiatives, continuously improve, and integrate AI-based solutions effectively.\n\n8. **Advanced Root Cause & Multi-Layer Analysis**  \n   - *Description:* Learn how to peel back multiple layers of root causes and see how they combine to form complex problems.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Combining methods: 5 Whys + fishbone + data-driven analysis  \n     - Distinguishing “symptom-level” from “systemic” root causes  \n     - Ensuring solution addresses the real drivers (e.g., inventory policies, order cycles, route constraints)\n\n9. **Solution Design & Rapid Prototyping**  \n   - *Description:* Turn analysis into targeted interventions with iterative pilots (e.g., for SL Kjøl).  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Prototyping a forecasting model with real data from Luminate & SAP  \n     - Creating incremental solutions: start small, measure, and refine  \n     - Bridging the gap between technical (AI-driven) and process changes (roles, responsibilities)\n\n10. **Implementation & Change Management**  \n    - *Description:* Plan the shift from “as-is” to “to-be” states, ensuring organizational adoption.  \n    - *Key Points:*  \n      - Governance structure: who owns and maintains the AI model and forecasting process  \n      -

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Topic: Enhancing Skill Tree with Advanced System Thinking Knowledge, Domain: unknown, Outcome: Refined the System Thinker skill tree to emphasize theoretical knowledge, separated organizational/project-specific content, and structured each section as an LLM sub-agent with clear context, goals, and input/output formats."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let me know if any of this is unclear before I finalize. Below is a draft **System Thinker** skill tree designed for your MMORPG-inspired setting. The idea is that each “skill” can be stored as a separate markdown file (or node in your app) and used as context to help LLM agents generate more precise, structured answers for projects like the “mellomtransport” improvement initiative.\n\n---\n\n## **Skill Tree: System Thinker**\n\n### **Tier 1 – Foundational Understanding**\nThese skills focus on the basics of systems thinking and why it’s important for projects such as mellomtransport cost optimization.\n\n1. **Concept of Systems Thinking**  \n   - *Description:* Understand what systems thinking is: seeing the whole rather than isolated parts.  \n   - *Key Points:* \n     - Definition of a “system” and interconnectivity of its components  \n     - Why local optimizations don’t always lead to global improvements  \n     - Basics of cause-and-effect in complex organizations  \n\n2. **Defining the Problem**  \n   - *Description:* Master the ability to frame a problem correctly before jumping to solutions (e.g., 5 Whys).  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Importance of distinguishing symptoms vs. root causes  \n     - Use of 5 Whys, Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams  \n     - Recognizing “mellomtransport cost” is a symptom—what drives that cost?\n\n3. **Organizational Context**  \n   - *Description:* Be aware of your company’s structure, goals, and constraints—vital for seeing how a single project (like mellomtransport) fits into the bigger picture.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Where mellomtransport sits in the supply chain (SL Kjøl, SL Tørr, ASKO Transport, etc.)  \n     - Key stakeholders, organizational silos, and decision-making processes  \n     - Basics of corporate strategies (cost-saving targets, service level commitments)\n\n---\n\n### **Tier 2 – Intermediate Analysis Skills**\nOnce you grasp the fundamentals, level up to tools that let you map, measure, and analyze complex systems more thoroughly.\n\n4. **System Mapping & Value-Stream Analysis**  \n   - *Description:* Learn techniques for visually mapping processes and identifying flows (goods, information, money).  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Value-stream mapping (steps from order forecasting to transport planning)  \n     - Identifying bottlenecks in SL (e.g., last-minute capacity planning for mellomtransport)  \n     - Recognizing interplay between forecasting tools (Luminate, SAP, IMI WH)  \n\n5. **Causal Loop Diagrams**  \n   - *Description:* Understand how feedback loops create reinforcing or balancing dynamics.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Positive (reinforcing) vs. negative (balancing) loops  \n     - Example: More last-minute changes \\=> higher cost \\=> more attempts at quick fixes \\=> can lead to even more last-minute changes  \n     - Identifying leverage points (e.g., earlier planning or improved forecast accuracy)\n\n6. **Measuring Variability & Constraints**  \n   - *Description:* Identify how variability (e.g., seasonal volumes, promotions) and constraints (e.g., truck capacity, cut-off times) affect overall system performance.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Different types of constraints: physical (truck capacity), time-based (stopptid), operational (warehouse throughput)  \n     - Effects of demand volatility on transport planning  \n     - Concept of lead times and buffering\n\n7. **Stakeholder & Interdependency Analysis**  \n   - *Description:* Understand how different internal and external parties (warehouse, transport planners, stores) are interdependent.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Identifying each stakeholder’s KPIs and constraints  \n     - Facilitating workshops to reveal hidden dependencies (e.g., store ordering patterns that spike demand unpredictably)  \n     - Communication strategies to align on shared goals\n\n---\n\n### **Tier 3 – Advanced Systems Thinking & Application**\nMaster-level skills that enable you to guide large-scale initiatives, continuously improve, and integrate AI-based solutions effectively.\n\n8. **Advanced Root Cause & Multi-Layer Analysis**  \n   - *Description:* Learn how to peel back multiple layers of root causes and see how they combine to form complex problems.  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Combining methods: 5 Whys + fishbone + data-driven analysis  \n     - Distinguishing “symptom-level” from “systemic” root causes  \n     - Ensuring solution addresses the real drivers (e.g., inventory policies, order cycles, route constraints)\n\n9. **Solution Design & Rapid Prototyping**  \n   - *Description:* Turn analysis into targeted interventions with iterative pilots (e.g., for SL Kjøl).  \n   - *Key Points:*  \n     - Prototyping a forecasting model with real data from Luminate & SAP  \n     - Creating incremental solutions: start small, measure, and refine  \n     - Bridging the gap between technical (AI-driven) and process changes (roles, responsibilities)\n\n10. **Implementation & Change Management**  \n    - *Description:* Plan the shift from “as-is” to “to-be” states, ensuring organizational adoption.  \n    - *Key Points:*  \n      - Governance structure: who owns and maintains the AI model and forecasting process  \n      - Training & rollout: how stakeholders interpret and trust model outputs  \n      - Continuous improvement: building feedback loops that refine the solution as context changes\n\n11. **Systems Governance & Continuous Feedback**  \n    - *Description:* Sustain the solution’s effectiveness through ongoing governance and iterative improvement.  \n    - *Key Points:*  \n      - Establishing performance metrics (e.g., transport utilization, forecast error rates, cost savings)  \n      - Regular reviews and model tuning (addressing data drift, changing business conditions)  \n      - Integration with other strategic initiatives within the company\n\n---\n\n### **Tier 4 – Thought Leadership & Scaling**\nFor those who aim to lead enterprise-wide transformations (and push the MMORPG storyline to “legendary” skill status).\n\n12. **Enterprise Architecture & Cross-Functional Synergy**  \n    - *Description:* Connect the mellemtransport project to broader enterprise goals, bridging multiple domains (finance, marketing, operations).  \n    - *Key Points:*  \n      - Aligning high-level strategy (cost savings, customer service) with on-the-ground processes  \n      -

Also this skill actually cannot have mix in references to our organisation or the actualy project in the system thinker skill tree yet, the llm will get this information or context from other players or cities or skills. However, the skill tree should have distinct and separate sections on our org or projects or any of our company information and so on related to system thinking so you can start building those out based on the knowledge i have given you, but they must be separate from the system thinking theory, not necessarily separate files, but just separate paragraphs or sections. I also want you to rethink the structure for each markdown. Remember the skill is actually a sub agent, meaning you should structure the markdown as you would structure an agent with context for an llm, meaning be clever about the prompt and the goal and the step by step instructions, the input and output formats, the responsibility this sub agent has, so the players main agent knows when to use which skill, remember the limited context window an llm agent has"}]}
